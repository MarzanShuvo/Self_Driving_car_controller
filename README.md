# Introduction to Self-Driving Cars

This course has helped me to:

* Understand commonly used hardware used for self-driving cars

* Identify the main components of the self-driving software stack

* Program vehicle modelling and control

* Analyze the safety frameworks and current industry practices for vehicle development

> At the end of this courese, I had to develop a control code to navigate a self-driving car around a racetrack in the CARLA simulation environment. :rocket: :metal:

# Requirements:

* Linear Algebra (matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication, rank, Eigenvalues and vectors and inverses)

* Statistics (Gaussian probability distributions)

* Calculus and Physics (forces, moments, inertia, Newton's Laws)
